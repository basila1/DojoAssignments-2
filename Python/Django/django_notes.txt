Most ALL enterprise level web applications are built using an MVC framework, and it's CRITICAL that you

Flask example:
    @app.route('/', methods = ['GET', 'POST'])
    def index():
      return render_template('index.html')

Django example:
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', views.index),
    ]

urlpatterns list is most important from urls.py file. Django uses regex to match routes.
First pattern (r'^$') is the equivalent of '/'.

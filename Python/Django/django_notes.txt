| MVC |
=======

MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is a way of organizing code to help create robust web applications.
Most ALL enterprise level web applications are built using an MVC framework, and it's CRITICAL that you
understand how to build your web application using one.

===========
| Intro 1 |
===========

Flask example:
    @app.route('/', methods = ['GET', 'POST'])
    def index():
      return render_template('index.html')

Django example:
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', views.index),
    ]

urlpatterns list is most important from urls.py file. Django uses regex to match routes.
First pattern (r'^$') is the equivalent of '/'.

Much like in Flask, the pages that are going to be rendered are found in the templates folder.
In general, we actually put a secondary folder inside the templates folder with the name of our app.
Putting our pages that get rendered inside a secondary folder helps us organize our code as we use/build
more and more apps.

Controller methods generally:
    * Redirect to other routes
    * Render specific templates
    * Invoke methods attached to other places of our app that we characterize as models

===================
| Getting Started |
===================

1. Navigate to location where you want to create your project.
        django-admin startproject main
    This will create the main project for us, from which we're going to make a few small set-up things
    before we can really get going.
2. Navigate to main directory that you just created. Create directory, "apps". Go into the apps directory.
3. Create an __init__.py file.
4. Create new app by running:
        python ../manage.py startapp first_app
5. Add "apps.first_app" to INSTALLED_APPS list in the /main/settings.py file.
6. Open main/urls.py in text editor and tell it to get routes from first_app.
7. Create urls.py file in first_app.
----------IF YOU RUN THE SERVER NOW... THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU WILL SEE---------
    raise ImproperlyConfigured(msg.format(name=self.urlconf_name))
    django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The included URLconf '<module 'apps.first_app.urls' from
    'C:\Users\UC\Desktop\DojoAssignments\Python\Django\main\apps\first_app\urls.py'>' does not appear to
    have any patterns in it. If you see valid patterns in the file then the issue is probably caused by a
    circular import.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once an HTTP request is made, the routing file (urls.py) decides which controller/method runs.

==========================
| apps/first_app/urls.py |
==========================
Example of urls.py file that is modularized.
        from django.conf.urls import url
        from . import views           # This line is new!
        urlpatterns = [
          url(r'^$', views.index)     # This line has changed!
        ]

Breaking it down:
    * from django.conf.urls import url
        This gives us access to the variable url (which points to a function)
    * from . import views
        This gives us access to everything in a views.py file that Django automatically created for us
        when we built our first_app.
    * url(r'^$', views.index)
        * Uses the url method in a way that's similar to the @app.route method in flask. The r after the ( identifies
        the following string to match as a regular expression pattern.
        * In this case, it will exactly match an empty string. That means if you were to go to localhost:8000/,
        Django (after removing the '/' automatically) will check if anything matches.
        * In this case, it does! An empty string is what r'^$' looks for. Since the pattern matches, we run the
        views.index method.
        * url() will eventually take another parameter, something like name='index', which we'll introduce when
        we talk about named routes.

===========================
| apps/first_app/views.py |
===========================

Example:
        from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse
        # Create your views here.
        def index(request):
          response = "Hello, I am your first request!"
          return HttpResponse(response)

While Django automatically creates the request object for us that's passed into our method. HttpResponse objects
are our responsibility to create and return to the browser. Note that 'render' is a shortcut method that combines
a given template with a given context dictionary and returns an HttpResponse object with that rendered text.
We aren't using render because we haven't created any templates yet.

========================
| REAL VIEWS OF DJANGO |
========================

********* REMEMBER *********
    + Django Models is MODEL in MVC
    + Django Templates (living in templates directory) is the VIEW in MVC
    + Django Views (living in views.py) is the CONTROLLER in MVC

Role of:
    * Model: Performs heavy logic, queries database
    * Template: Holds HTML (plus any Python code) that will be rendered and sent to browser
    * View: Receives an HTTP request from routes.py and decides what to do (i.e. redirect,
        call a model method, render some HTML)

================
| Static files |
================

In our views file, Django knows to look in the templates folder first for whatever path we pass to our render
method.

Example:
        # views.py
         ...
         def index(request):
           return render(request, "ourApp/index.html")

Behavior for static files is similar: Django's template rendering system knows to look in the static and
then at the path for the specific file relative to that folder.

What HTML looks like:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
           <head>
             <meta charset="utf-8">
             <title></title>
               {% load staticfiles %}
             <!-- The line above tells Django to be ready to listen for static files -->
             <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'ourApp/css/main.css' %}"media="screen" title="no title"  charset="utf-8">
             </head>
           <body>
           </body>
         </html>

========================
| Session Data & Forms |
========================
Key Terms:
    * request.POST
        - Data from POST request
    * request.GET
        - Data from GET request
    * request.method
        - Returns the method/HTTP verb associated with the request
    * {% csrf_token %}
        - Prevents cross-site request forgery (place it in a form on the HTML/template sdie of your project)

Set up to use session:
In terminal, go to where manage.py is...
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate

Use session: request.session # It's a dictionary, so you can attach key/value pairs.

Useful session methods:
    * request.session['key']
        - This will retrieve (get) the value stored in key
    * request.session['key'] = 'value'
        - Set the value that will be stored by key
    * del request.session['key']
        - Deletes a session key if it exists, throws a keyError if it doesn't.
            Use along with try and except since it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
    * 'key' in request.session
        - Returns a boolean of whether a key is in session or not.
    * {{ request.session.name }}
        - Use dot notation (.) to access request.session keys from templates since square brackets
            aren't allowed here.

*** Session in Django gets saved even if we leave the browser! ***

========================
| Contextual Variables |
========================

Minimize use of request.session, limiting to just a few reference pieces such as name and ID of logged-in user.

So we have to use contextual variables.
What is context? It's just a dictionary that gets unpacked in the template, making all the keys variables that
equal the corresponding value.

Example:
Django:
        from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse, redirect
        def index(request):
        	context = {
        		"email" : "blog@gmail.com",
        		"name" : "mike"
        	}
        	return render(request, "second_app/index.html", context)

In index.html, the context dictionary gets unpacked, and we have access to email and name.

HTML:
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <title>Document</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                {{email}} and {{name}}
            </body>
        </html>

====================
| Route Parameters |
====================

Passing variable via URL:
In urls.py...
        from django.conf.urls import url
         from . import views
         urlpatterns = [
             url(r'^/en/(?P<id>\d+)$', views.show)
         ]

In views.py...
        def show(request, id):
         context = {
           "id" : id
         }
         return render(request, "second_app/show.html", context)

================
| Static files |
================

Put static files in directory called "static" that lives alongside "templates". Just like with templates
it's the convention to place another directory inside static with the same name as your app. That's
because we could potentially be accessing multiple apps from within our own.

To access static files from HTML:
      <!-- Inside apps/first_app/templates/first_app/index.html -->
      {% load staticfiles %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'first_app/css/styles.css' %}">
      <script src="{% static 'first_app/js/main.js' %}" > </script>

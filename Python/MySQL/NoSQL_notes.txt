NoSQL Databases:

NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled
in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Sometimes called
"Not only SQL" to emphasize that may support SQL-like query languages.

SQL Way vs NoSQL Way:
Let's say that you want to store information about every single person on the earth...
    SQL : Come up with survey with what information you want to capture (e.g. Name, Gender)
    NoSQL : Allowing user who's filling out the survey to write whatever field they want

Some types of NoSQL databases:
    * Key-Value Cache: Coherence, eXtreme Scale, GigaSpaces, GemFire
    * Key-Value Store: ArangoDB, Flare, Keyspace, RAMCloud
    * Key-Value Store (Eventually-Consistent): DovetailDB, Oracle NoSQL Database, Dynamo, Riak
    * Key-Value Store (Ordered): Actord, FoundationDB, Lightcloud, LMDB
    * Data-Structures Server: Redis
    * Tuple Store: Apache River, Coord, GigaSpaces
    * Object Database: DB4O, Objectivity/DB, Perst
    * Document Store: ArangoDB, Clusterpoint, Couchbase, MongoDB, XML-databases
    * Wide Column Store: BigTable, Cassandra, Druid

Notes - JavaScript v2 - Fundamentals

Functions in JavaScript are known as “First-Class”:
    * Functions can be stored as standalone functions (like above), as the value of variables,
        or as attributes in a JavaScript object (where they're known as methods)
    * Functions can be passed as arguments to functions (known as a callback)
    * Functions can be returned from functions. (This is creating what’s called a closure,
        which we’ll discuss later.)

Ternary operator: single line if-else check
    Ex: (condition) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)

Do-while Loops:
    Ex:
        do {
            // CODE HERE
        } while (parent_permission)

Loops can be used on both arrays (by index), as well as objects (by key).
    Ex:
        for (var key in ninja) {
            if (ninja.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                console.log(key);
                console.log(ninja[key]);
            }
        }

Arrays are generally used to keep track of a list of related things of the same type.
While objects are generally used to keep attributes of a thing associated with that thing.

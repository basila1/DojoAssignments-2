JS Fundamentals II:

Turn the following problems from JS Fundamentals Part I into functions that take variable inputs

1. Create a simple for loop that sums all the integers between x and y (inclusive). Have it console log the final sum.
2. Write a loop that will go through an array, find the minimum value, and then return it
3. Write a loop that will go through an array, find the average of all of the values, and then return it

Rewrite these 3 as anonymous functions assigned to variables.
Rewrite these as methods of an object
Create a JavaScript object called person with the following properties/methods

Properties
name - set this as your own namedistance_traveled - set this initially as zero

Methods
say_name - should alert the object’s name property
say_something - have it accept a parameter. This function should then say for example “{{your name}} says ‘I am cool’” if you pass ‘I am cool’ as an argument to this method.
walk - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is walking” and increase distance_traveled by 3
run - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is running” and increase distance_traveled by 10
crawl - have it alert for example “{{your name}} is crawling” and increase distance_traveled by 1
